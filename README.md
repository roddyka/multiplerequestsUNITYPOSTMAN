# Postman Tool for Unity

The Postman Tool for Unity is a simple tool that allows you to test API requests directly within the Unity Editor. It provides an interface where you can specify the URL, HTTP method, headers, and send the request. The tool then displays the response in the Unity Console.

## Features

- Specify custom headers for the request.
- Display the response in the Unity Console.

## How to Use

1. Add the `PostmanWindow.cs` script to your Unity project.
2. In the Unity Editor, go to `Window -> Postman` to open the Postman Tool window.
3. Enter the URL of the API endpoint you want to test.
4. Select the desired HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
5. Optionally, add any headers required for the request.
6. Click the "Send Request" button to send the API request.
7. The response will be displayed in the Unity Console.
